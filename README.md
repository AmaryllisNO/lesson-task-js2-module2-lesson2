# JavaScript 2 - Module 2

## Lesson Task 1 Question

### Question 1

**Level 1**

Based on the below array of people, create a reusable function that will remove any person based on a user's ID.

The function should accept an argument for the id, filter out any matches and return the updated array.

```js
let users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Emma", gender: "Female" },
  { id: 2, name: "Oscar", gender: "Male" },
  { id: 3, name: "Alexis", gender: "Female" },
  { id: 4, name: "Adam", gender: "Male" },
];
```

**Level 2** _(optional)_

Convert the filter function you created in Level 1 into a one-line function.
